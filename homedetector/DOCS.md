## Installation

ðŸš¨ Warning: Home Detector is only support on 64bit processors, i.e. x86_64 (`amd64`) or ARM64 (`aarch64`) this is due to modern cryptography libraries (_used by Open Canary_) requiring rust which is not provided in the base python/alpine 32bit docker images. For Raspberry Pi users, that means Pi 4 or newer.

### Delayed Start
