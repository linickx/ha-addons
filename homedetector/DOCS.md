# Documentation

Congrats, you have a home Intrusion Detection System!

## Installation

ðŸš¨ Warning: Home Detector is only support on 64bit processors, i.e. x86_64 (`amd64`) or ARM64 (`aarch64`) this is due to modern cryptography libraries (_used by Open Canary_) requiring rust which is not provided in the base python/alpine 32bit docker images. For Raspberry Pi users, that means Pi 4 or newer.

# DNS Anomaly Detection for IoT

Home Detector implements a DNS server, it's not indent to replace complex solutions like PiHole, but rather complement them. It is **strongly recommended** that you do **not** point Phones/PCs/Laptops at this DNS server, you won't get much benefit. Where **you do benefit** is by configuring your Smart-Home or IoT devices as Home Assistant/Detector as a DNS server.

### What happens when IoT uses Home Assistant/Detector as a DNS server?

By Default, if you update your local DNS to use Home Detectors DNS server, nothing happens, all requests are passed through and resolved. However if you *enable* Anomaly Detection, then Home Detector will start creating a baseline of Domains your IoT/Smart-Home devices talk to. The baseline will be learnt over 30days, and after that learning period will become fixed. Any new Domains observed will generate an alert.

## Setting up DNS Anomaly Detection

By default DNS inspection is disabled, that is DNS requests pass-through without any anomaly detection, you must designate devices you wish to inspect, below is an example for setting __Local IoT Networks__:

```
- address: 192.168.1.10
  type: host
- address: 192.168.1.20-192.168.1.25
  type: range
- address: 192.168.2.0/24
  type: subnet
```
### Upstream DNS Servers

By default Home Detector will use Home Assistant DNS server, you can change this like so...

```
- server: 8.8.8.8
  port: 53
- server: 1.1.1.1
  port: 53
```
If you run _another_ DNS server on Home Assistant, like Pi-hole or DNSguard you need to grab their local name and use that, e.g for [my DNSCrypt addon](https://github.com/linickx/addon-dnscrypt-proxy)

```
- server: ba53f40c-dnscrypt-proxy
  port: 53
```
### Custom DNS Host Records (A)

If you need something resolvable, you can avoid it being sent upstream by creating custom A records:
```
- name: homeassistant.internal
  address: 192.168.1.1
```
### Detect on Host Query

Are you a hard-core paranoid security/privacy nerd, oh boy, you're gonna love this! By Default Home Detector will alert on Domain variations, but if you enable this feature it'll start tracking and alerting on the host level. For _nice_ devices, no drama, but if you have an Amazon Alexa prepared to be spammed as that thing connects to a whole bunch of random hosts all the time!

### DNS Firewall (Blocking)

By default **nothing is blocked**. If you wish to enable DNS Blocking, toggle this to on.

### Unknown IP Action

By default, only _configured_ IPs are subject to inspection. You can enable it for _all_ with this toggle, however *IMPORTANT NOTE* laptops/phone are incredibly noisy, as soon as 30days (learning mode) is up, an alert will be created for every new site visited, you probably don't want that ;)

### Learning Mode Duration & Network Scope TTL (Time to Live)

Anomaly detection works by recording all the DNS requests for a fixed period of time and then once over alerting when there is a deviation from this baseline.

* Learning Mode Duration -> Default 30days -> How long to create the baseline
* Network Scope TTL -> How often the Source IP should be re-validated to check it's learning status

### Manually Changing the status of a Domain (Query)

To manually update a Scope from Learning to Alerting/Blocking:

1. Open the [Home Detector Dashboard](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_ingress/?addon=ba53f40c_homedetector) select `DNS`
2. Click "pass" and change to "block"

___NOTE___: Keyword "block" will _alert_ if DNS firewalling is disabled.

### Manually Changing the status of a scope

To manually update a Scope from Learning to Alerting/Blocking:

1. Open the [Home Detector Dashboard](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_ingress/?addon=ba53f40c_homedetector) select `Tuning`
2. Click "learning" and change to "block"

___NOTE___: Keyword "block" will _alert_ if DNS firewalling is disabled.

# Open Canary Honeypot

Home Detector is an implementation of Open Canary, currently it's not _configurable_ but you can enable upto 3x different detection mechanisms:

1. Telnet
2. FTP
3. Web Server

### What's a Honeypot, and what can it detect?

A honeypot is a security tool that can help computer systems defend against cyber attacks, a target to lure threat actors away from legitimate targets. By default, only the Telnet honeypot is enabled, what this means is, if you connect (telnet) to your home assistant server, instead of getting a CLI like SSH, it'll generate an alert, for **any** username/password combination you type.

### Can I break into Home Assistant via the Honeypot?

Nopes, they're a python process faking a log-in prompt, there's nothing behind them.

## Honey Pot Setup

By default, Telnet (TCP/23) is enabled. Under the add-on configuration page, scroll to the bottom where the `Network Ports` are, toggle `Show disabled ports` .

* Enable the HTTP Honeypot by Setting a Port -> 80
* Enable the FTP Honeypot by Setting a Port -> 21

After the add-on restarts, if you browse to http://homeassistant.local (_or whatever_) you'll see a fake NAS page, it'll generate an alert, for **any** username/password combination you type.

Currently Open Canary cannot be further customized, but I'd like to change that!

# Example Automations

The following automations are [available in the docs](https://github.com/linickx/HomeDetector/tree/main/docs) folder:

### Delayed Start

An example automation for starting up Home Detector 30sec after boot: [automation_delayed_start.yml](https://github.com/linickx/HomeDetector/blob/main/homedetector/docs/automation_delayed_start.yml)

### Notify via webhook

Example automation for generating custom alerts via the webhook: [automation_webhook_notify.yml](https://github.com/linickx/HomeDetector/blob/main/homedetector/docs/automation_webhook_notify.yml)
