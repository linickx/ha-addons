# V0.0.2 - Move the DB!

During Development the sqlite DB was in `/share` so the [add-on for sqlite](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-sqlite-web) could be used for troubleshooting, a pull request to allow access to `/addons_config` [was declined](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-sqlite-web/pull/313) due to some weirdness.

This release moves the DB to the intended target location, and tests the update/release process ðŸ˜‰
